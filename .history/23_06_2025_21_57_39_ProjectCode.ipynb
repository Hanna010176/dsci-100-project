    "Introduction:\n",
    "There is a research group at UBC that is collecting data on how people play video games. They have collected data on players through a Minecreaft Server. They have presented us with many broad questions that we need to explore. The broad question that has been chosen for the project today is Which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so that we can target those players in our recruiting efforts. From this we have formulated a predictuve question, the question we are trying to answer is Can we predict the number of sessions players partake in a Minecraft server based on their age?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses two datasets that were taken from the minecraft server, the two CSV files are:\n",

    "sessions.csv(This dataset has specific information on the players sessions)\n",

    "**Discussion**\n",
    "From the plots and the data analysis that we have done, we were able to calculate the RMSE from linear regression, as well as see how our linear regression model acts on the training set of data and unseen data (testing set). When create the recipe and fit our model in the workflow, we get our equation of the line. Our equation of line is num_sessions = 18.6936 - 0.2928 * Age. The intercept (18.6936) is the predicted number of sessions for a player with an age = 0. The slope (-0.2928) indicates to us that in each additional year of age, the predicted number of sessions decreases by a value of around 0.29. This indicates to us that older indivdiuals tend to have less sessions compared to younger individuals. This equation indicates to use that age and number of sessions have a slight negative relationship. This could suggest to us that younger players tend to have more sessions and be more active on the minecraft server. \n",
    "\n",
    "My number of sessions seem to range from 0 to 100 sessions. My calculated RMSE value was 28.7. This indicates how off my number of sessions are from the actual number of sessions that occur. This seems to be a pretty big error and this could indicate that only age might not be a strong predictor for how many sessions a player tends to play. This could indicate that the relationship between age and num_session might just be very week, which is why we are seeing a large RMSE. This might indicate thato other variables other than age might play a bigger role in determining the number of sessions. This could also explain why when we look at the plots, our line of best-fit does not seem to go through the data points. The model is trying to find something to minimize error, however it leads to a trend not being followed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome was a little expected because it makes sense that not only age wil affect the number of sessions by players. There can be many other variables like lifestyle, personality, etc that could have a greater effect on the number of sessions. We did see a weak relationship, so it could have some effect, but we can see that it does not have a large effect. Now we know that the relationship between age and number of sessions is fairly weak, this opens up space for questions that can explore other variables, such as can someone's past experiences in a game lead to a greater number of sessions? Or, we can also test gender to see if that would have an effect on the number of sessions one partakes in. The impact of these findings is that now that we know age is not a strong predictor for number of sessions, we know that using promotional techniques to promote the Minecraft server to target age groups would not be that effective due to the data we have seen today. This indicates to game developers that we need to use non-age based promotional techniques instead. "
